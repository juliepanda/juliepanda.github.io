<p>I am a pretty lazy person by nature. I like learning new things, but I have a problem following through, which is why I tend to read more articles than I read books.</p>
<p>So, this year, I only made one resolution because I know that I am way too lazy to keep up with any list that that contains more than one items.</p>
<h3>No.1 Goal: commit everyday (to Github)</h3>
<p>My streak on Github is now 15 days in a row (whoohoo), most if not all were commits to the <a href="https://github.com/Julie-Chelsea">foreign language learning project</a> Chelsea and I are working on, which is the only way I can really learn webdev.</p>
<p>While I was trying out this goal, I learned a couple things about how Github keeps track of &quot;streak&quot; for its user.<br></p>
<h4>How Github Counts Streak</h4>
<p>First an formost, it really only counts your commits as streaks as long as you don't delete the projects you made the commits with. If you kept a long streak going, and created a project of which you worked on for 3 days and then went on to working on other projects, then you one day decided to delete the project, Github would count your streak from the point after you worked on the project you deleted, which means that you lost all the streak days you have accumulated prior to the day you worked on the deleted project.<br></p>
<h4>Branching</h4>
<p>If you created a branch and did some work with it, until the branch is merged with the master, your work will not be counted. So, when I created a branch to test out some user stuff for the lang project I was working, my streak was zero until I merged the branch to the master and my streak returned to what it was plus the days I worked in the branch.</p>
<p>There are still probably a lot of rules that I haven't discover, but these are the ones that I have discovered.</p>
<p>There are days when I am lazy, and my only commit would be &quot;fix typo&quot;, but I hope that by developing a habit of coding regularly, I can familiarize myself with various tools that can help me become a better creator. *<em>fingers crossed</em>*</p>
